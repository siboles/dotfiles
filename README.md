## Description
These are the dotfiles pertinent to my system configuration and workflow. I start a few programs in my i3 config that you may need to disable. These are:

* dropbox-cli
* thunderbird
* [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/)
* pidgin

You can delete the lines that exec these in .config/i3/config.

## Dependencies
* [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) This fork of i3 may be available in your distribution's repository. If you want to just use i3wm remove/comment the blocked section i3-gaps options .config/i3/config.
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) If you are using another shell i.e. BASH then you don't need this. 
* [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) Again check your distribution's repository first.
* [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) Not in main repositories. See Getting Started on their readme.
* [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) This screen compositer is not necessary. Just comment out the lines starting it in .config/i3/config. It is likely available in your distribution's repo.
* [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) This is the terminal I currently use. Pre-built binaries are available [See Quickstart](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
* emacs - Change the EDITOR and GIT_EDITOR variables in .zprofile if you want to use something different.
* feh - Image viewer to set the background
